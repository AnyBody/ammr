//Estimation according to Wu et al. 2008. These values are for the index finger. As a simplification every phalanx is treated as the one from the index finger with only a different length
//metacarpal phalanxes are treated as extended proximal phalanxes
// The bone canal is roughly 25% shorter than the external bone measurement
