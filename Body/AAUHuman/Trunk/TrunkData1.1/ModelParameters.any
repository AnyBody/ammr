/** A detailed model of the human lumbar spine.

Trunk.root.any is the root file for the lumbar spine model with muscles.

You can read more about this lumbar spine model and some prelimary validation in the following article:
de Zee, M., L. Hansen, C. Wong, J. Rasmussen, and E.B. Simonsen. A generic detailed rigid-body
lumbar spine model. J.Biomech. 40: 1219-1227, 2007.

Data of vertebrae dimensions is taken from Nissan and Gilad (J.Biomech. 19: 753-758, 1986)
and also the WholeBodyParameters.

Some important facts about this model
- The model is only partly evaluated. More validation is needed for your own purpose.
- The model does not include facet joints.
- The muscles do not include the force-length-velocity relations (i.e. we use the socalled simple muscle model).
  The only input parameter in the muscle model is the cross-sectional area multiplied by a factor. Daggfeldt and
  Thorstensson (J.Biomech. 2003, 36: 815-825) didn't include the force-length-velocity relations either.
- Ligaments are not included in this model, because we do not have the necessary mechanical properties. This
  is however not a problem, because it has been shown that the torque production from ligaments might not be very important
  (Cholewicki and McGill, J.Biomech. 1992, 25: 17-28).
  
The model contains a preliminary model of the Intra Abdominal pressure (IAP). In short the IAP is modelled as constant volume,
which, when squeezed from the side by the transversus muscles extends the spine by pushing on the rib thorax
and the pelvic floor. From the mathematical point-ofview,this lets the abdominal muscles function as spine
extensors, and they become part of the whole recruitment problem. The limit of the IAP was set to
26600 Pa, which was based on measurements on well-trained subjects (Essendrop, M., 2003. Significance of intra-abdominal pressure in work
related trunk-loading. Ph.D. Thesis, National Institute of Occupational Health, Denmark.) and using geometric/anatomic estimates of pressure surface
area and area centroids, which in turn determines the effective moment arm of the pressure.
