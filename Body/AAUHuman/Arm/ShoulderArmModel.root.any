This is the root file for the shoulder-arm model

This model contains data from two different persons. Most of the data that has been used in this model comes from the Dutch
Shoulder Group and can be found on the following webpage http://www.fbw.vu.nl/research/Lijn_A4/shoulder/overview.htm
The model is built using data from subject 2 from the VU study and subject 2 from the 
MAYO study.

The files, which contains the name "forearm", are built on data from the MAYO study
The model contains the following files:
"Seg.any" Inertia properties of all segments and definitions of surfaces used for wrapping
"ClavicleMuscleGeometry.any" nodes for muscle attacments VU sub2
"HumerusMuscleGeometry".any" nodes for muscle attacments VU sub2
"RadiusMuscleGeometry.any" nodes for muscle attacments MAYO sub2
"ScapulaMuscleGeometry.any" nodes for muscle attacments VU sub2
"UlnaMuscleGeometry.any"nodes for muscle attacments VU sub2
"jnt.any" joint definitions for the shoulder and arm
"jnt.nomuscles.any" special joint file for the shoulder and arm to be used when no muscles is used, all joints has reaction forces applied 
"ArtificialRakeForDeltoidMuscle.any" this the file which contains an artificial segment used for controlling the wrapping of the deltoid muscle
"AddOnOutsideBlockForKinematics.any" adding stuff for the scapulo-thoracic gliding plane to the thorax segment
"AddOnOutsideBlockForMuscles.any" adding wrapping geometries to segments which are not part of the block
"Glove.any" model of a glove which simulates the strength capabilities of the hand
"GloveMuscle.any" muscles for the glove here the strength of the glove can be adjusted
"muscle.any" muscle definitons for the shoulder and upper arm
"muscle-parameters-shoulder.any" muscle strength parameters for the arm
"muscle-parameters-shoulder-const.any" muscle strength parameters for the arm
"muscle-parameters-shoulder-const_simple.any" muscle strength parameters for the arm
"WristMuscle.any" this files adds artificial muscles to the wrist 
"PosDumperRight.any"  this file is used for dumping the coordinates and orientations of the segments in a right shoulder
"PosDumperLeft.any"   this file is used for dumping the coordinates and orientations of the segments in a left shoulder

The raw data from http://www.fbw.vu.nl/research/Lijn_A4/shoulder/overview.htm has been converted using a small Matlab program, 
which automatically transforms the global coordinates into local coordinates on the segments.

Known issues:

1: The model seems to be too weak for the load applied when doing pushups. This is a sign that the shoulder needs more 
adjustments before it becomes reliable
2: More work has to be done on muscle calibration. At present one posture is used for calibrating all muscles.
The file "shouldercalibration.any", which defines this, can be found in the applications in the Application directory

NOTE: 
The comment "Correction" generally means that numbers have been changed and do not follow the published data

http://www.fbw.vu.nl/research/Lijn_A4/shoulder/isg/proposal/protocol.htm

The arm has the following basic dof, which can be controlled by combinations joint drivers directly or indirectly through
connections to the environment

SternoClavicularProtraction
SternoClavicularElevation
SternoClavicularAxialRotation

GlenohumeralFlexion 
GlenohumeralAbduction
GlenohumeralExternalRotation

ElbowFlexion
ElbowPronation

WristFlexion 
WristAbduction

The model consist of the following joints:

SC SternoClavicular: spherical joint 
AC AcromioClavicular: spherical joint 
GH Glenohumeral joint: spherical (normal reactions of the spherical joint is not used unstead they are created so that they fall
within the glenoid cavity the file, please see the file GHReactions.any for details)

AI One dimensional constraint between the scapula and the thorax at the bonylandmark AI om scapula
AA One dimensional constraint between the scapula and the thorax at the bonylandmark AA om scapula

ConoideumLigament : the lenght of this segment is driven to a constant lenght

FE Flexion extension of the elbow: revolute joint  

PS pronation supination joint or the forearm: combination of joints in distal and proximal end of the radius bone that leaves one dof
free which is pronation/supination of the forearm

Wrist joint: created as two revolute joints where the axis of rotations are not coincident
