::::::

Open body models
: All models are open and editable with the AnyScript model language

Configurable Human model
: Configure and combine different body models into a full body model

Lots of Application examples
: Gallery of example models provide a good starting point for modeling

Community effort
: Models are combined effort of many research groups over two decades


The AnyBody Model Repository (AMMR), is an unique open library of
musculoskeletal models and examples ready to be used with the [AnyBody Modeling
System][anybody modeling system]. The AnyBody Managed Model Repository consists of two parts:

If you are a new user check the [AnyBody Tutorials](https://anyscript.org/tutorials/) and the getting started video on AnyBody.

The following {doc}`Getting Started section </getting_started>` on the AMMR provides insight into how AMMR is structured, how to
install it and how to use it.

The models are developed in research projects at academic institutions or by
AnyBody Technology in collaboration with academic institutions. The models are
maintained by AnyBody Technology who ensure that various body part models can be
used together as a full body, scalable musculoskeletal model.
