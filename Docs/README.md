# AnyBody Managed Model Repository 
> An open library of musculoskeletal models

The AnyBody Model Repository (AMMR), is an open library of musculoskeletal
models and examples ready to be used with the [AnyBody Modeling
System](https://www.anybodytech.com/software/ams/).

> **Note**
> An AnyBody license with active maintenance is required to use the models from GitHub. 
> Please see the [beta program](https://forum.anyscript.org/t/become-a-beta-tester/5056/6).

The AnyBody Managed Model Repository consists of two parts:

* [Body Models](https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/body/models.html): The human body
  models which can be customized and scaled to build a specific musculoskeletal
  model.
* [Application examples](https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/auto_examples/index.html):
  in which the body models are utilized in specific applications (from everyday
  activities, like pushing the acceleration or brake pedals of a car, to
  workplace-specific scenarios).

The models are developed in research projects at academic institutions or by
[AnyBody Technology](https://www.anybodytech.com) in collaboration with academic
institutions. The models are maintained by [AnyBody
Technology](https://www.anybodytech.com) who ensure that various body part models
can be used together as a full body, scalable musculoskeletal model.


## Getting Started

This repository on GitHub is the development version of the AMMR. It contains all cutting edge
development and improvements to the Body models. The repository also contain a number extra 
files for building the documentation, and testing the models. Official releases are distributed
with the [AnyBody Modeling System](https://www.anybodytech.com/software/anybodymodelingsystem/),
or available with a DOI from [zendo.org/communities/anybody](https://zenodo.org/communities/anybody/). 

Please see the [AMMR documentation](https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/beta) for more
information on getting started using the AMMR.
