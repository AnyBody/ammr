# AnyBody Managed Model Repository 
> An open library of musculoskeletal models


The AnyBody Model Repository (AMMR), is an open library of musculoskeletal
models and examples ready to be used with the [AnyBody Modeling
System](https://www.anybodytech.com/software/ams/).

</p>

The AnyBody Managed Model Repository consists of two parts:

* [Body Models](https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/body/models.html): The human body
  models which can be customized and scaled to build a specific musculoskeletal
  model.
* [Application examples](https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/auto_examples/index.html):
  in which the body models are utilized in specific applications (from everyday
  activities, like pushing the acceleration or brake pedals of a car, to
  workplace-specific scenarios).

The models are developed in research projects at academic institutions or by
[AnyBody Technology](https://anybodytech.com) in collaboration with academic
institutions. The models are maintained by [AnyBody
Technology](https://anybodytech.com) who ensure that various body part models
can be used together as a full body, scalable musculoskeletal model.


## Getting Started

This is the development version of the AMMR repository, which contain a number
extra files for testing and building the documentation. Official releases which
also include documentation are distributed with the [AnyBody Modeling
System](https://www.anybodytech.com/software/ams/), or available with a DOI from
[zendo.org/communities/anybody](https://zenodo.org/communities/anybody/). 

Please see the [AMMR documentation](https://anyscript.org/ammr-doc/dev) for more
information on getting started using the AMMR.

## Contributing

Development takes place in a closed [repository on
Github](https://github.com/anybody/ammr) to protect academic contributors
who also often need to publish their models before release. Access to the closed
Github repository is given on request. 

Please [submit an issue here](https://github.com/AnyBody/ammr-doc/issues), to request access. 

<!---
A [public mirror](https://gihub.com/anybody/ammr) exists on GitHub in which the
[main development
branch](https://github.com/AnyBody-Research-Group/AMMR/commits/master) is
available. Pull request are very welcome on GitHub.
