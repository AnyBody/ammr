# AnyBody Managed Model Repository 
> An open library of musculoskeletal models

> [!TIP]

The AnyBody Model Repository (AMMR), is an open library of musculoskeletal
models and examples for the [AnyBody Modeling
System](https://www.anybodytech.com/software/ams/).

</p>

The AnyBody Managed Model Repository consists of two parts:

* [Body Models](https://anyscript.org/ammr/beta/body/models.html): The human body
  models which can be customized and scaled to build a specific musculoskeletal
  model.
* [Application examples](https://anyscript.org/ammr/beta/Applications/index.html):
  where body models are used in specific applications (from everyday
  activities with MoCap, othopaedics simulations, to ergonomic workcenarios).

The models are developed in research projects at academic institutions or by
[AnyBody Technology](https://www.anybodytech.com) in collaboration with academic
institutions. The models are maintained by [AnyBody
Technology](https://www.anybodytech.com) who ensure that various body part models
can be used together as a full body, scalable musculoskeletal model.

> [!IMPORTANT]
An AnyBody license with active maintenance is required to use the models from GitHub. 
Please see the [beta program](https://forum.anyscript.org/t/become-a-beta-tester/5056), or request a [trial license ](https://www.anybodytech.com/contact/)



## Getting Started

This repository on GitHub is the development version of the AMMR. It contains all cutting edge
development and improvements to the Body models. The repository also contain a number extra 
files for building the documentation, and testing the models. Official releases are distributed
with the [AnyBody Modeling System](https://www.anybodytech.com/software/anybodymodelingsystem/),
or available with a DOI from [zendo.org/communities/anybody](https://zenodo.org/communities/anybody/). 

Please see the [AMMR documentation](https://anyscript.org/ammr/beta) for more
information on getting started using the AMMR.

License Agreement (EULA). Please see the ["License certificate"](../LICENSE) file include with 
this repository for more information. 

If you don' agree to the terms of the EULA (which may be updated from time to time) you are not
allowed to use the AMMR.

## Contributing

All contributions are welcome and greatly appreciated. 

If you find a bug or have comments to the code please report it on the [AnyScript
