Femoral Torsion tool
=======================================

This is an example of modifying the femoral torsion using a model utility tool
included with the model repository. The  model is simple standing model where
the femoral torsion has been altered to -5 degrees. The model is also a good 
example on how a similar approach can be used for other body parts.

The tool was developed by Enrico De Peiri at University of Basel Childrenâ€™s
Hospital as part of his work on how hip joint loadings are influenced by femoral
torsion which is published in 'Fronties in Bioengineering and Biotechnology'
[DFLM21]_. Please cite his work if you use this tool.

   The tools works by adding a 8 control points around the hip center and knee center, which control a RBF scale function.
   The control points are scaled witht the default model scaling with the femoral torsion added on top.

The model tool is a simple include file located in the model repository. It can
be included in any model using the following code:

.. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc

  // The femoral torsion tool expects the following variables to be defined 
  Main.HumanModel.Anthropometrics = {
     AnyVar FemoralTorsionRight = -5;
     AnyVar FemoralTorsionLeft = -5;
  };
  
  // This line must be included before the "HumanModel".
  #include "<ANYBODY_PATH_MODELUTILS>/FemoralTorsion/FemoralTorsionInclude.any"


.. note:: The current tibial torsion in the unscaled (TLEM 2.0 cadaver) model
        approx. 5 degrees. So setting the femoral torsion to 5 degrees will not
        modify the model.

The tool uses a functionality override scaling for thigh segments. In this case
the include file sets ``#define CUSTOM_SCALING_Right_Thigh`` and ``#define
CUSTOM_SCALING_Left_Thigh`` to override the default scaling for the right/left
thigh. 

.. seealso:: The tool uses a functionality override scaling for thigh segments. In this case
   the include file sets ``#define CUSTOM_SCALING_Right_Thigh`` and ``#define
   CUSTOM_SCALING_Left_Thigh``. See the :doc:`scaling tutorial <tutorials:Scaling/lesson4>` for more
   information on how to use the custom scaling functionality in the general
   case.
