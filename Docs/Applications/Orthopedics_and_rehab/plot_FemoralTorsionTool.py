Femoral Torsion tool
=======================================

This is an example of modifying the femoral torsion of the generic TLEM geometry 
by using a model utility tool included within the model repository. 
The  model is the simple standing model where the femoral torsion has been altered to 25 degrees. 
The model is also a good example on how a similar morphing approach can be used to personalize different body segments.

The tool was developed by Enrico De Pieri, from the University of Basel Childrenâ€™s Hospital (UKBB),
and Morten E. Lund, from AnyBody Technology A/S.
This tool was developed in order to generate personalized models that account for subject-specific values of femoral torsion,
and investigate the effect of torsional alignment on hip loading. 
This work is published in 'Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology' [DFLM21]_. 
Please cite this article when using this tool.

   :align: center

   The tools works by adding a 8 control points around the hip center and knee center, which control a RBF scale function.
   The control points are scaled with the default model scaling, while the femoral torsion is added on top.

   :align: center

   The origin and insertion points of the muscles follow the morphed femoral geometry.


The model tool is a simple include file located in the model repository. It can
be included in any model using the following code:

.. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc

  // The femoral torsion tool expects the following variables to be defined 
  Main.HumanModel.Anthropometrics = {
     AnyVar FemoralTorsionRight = 20;
     AnyVar FemoralTorsionLeft = 20;
  };
  
  // This line must be included before the "HumanModel".
  #include "<ANYBODY_PATH_MODELUTILS>/FemoralTorsion/FemoralTorsionInclude.any"


.. note:: The current femoral torsion in the unscaled (TLEM 2.0 cadaver) model geometry is
        approx. 5.5 degrees. So setting the femoral torsion to 5.5 degrees will not
        modify the model.

The tool uses a functionality override scaling for thigh segments. In this case
the include file sets ``#define CUSTOM_SCALING_Right_Thigh`` and ``#define
CUSTOM_SCALING_Left_Thigh`` to override the default scaling for the right/left
thigh. 

.. seealso:: See the :doc:`scaling tutorial <tutorials:Scaling/lesson4>` for more
   information on how to use the custom scaling functionality in the general
   case.
