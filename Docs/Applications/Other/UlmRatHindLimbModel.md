# Rat Hindlimb model

The Ulm Rat hindlimb model is a simlation of the internal forces and moments in
the femur of a rat during gait. The model is based on the work of Tim Wehner and
colleagues from Ulm University in Germany. The model is based on micro CT scans
of the lower extremity of 15 rats. Kinematics was created from x-ray movies in
two different planes. This model is good example of small stand alone model to answer a specific
research question.

The main file of the model is located at:
