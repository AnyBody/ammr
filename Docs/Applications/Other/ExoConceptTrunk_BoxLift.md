Trunk exoskeleton concept model.

This simple example shows how the effects of an exoskeleton can be investigated by applying assistive torque
directly at the human joints.

The model points to the existing {ref}`BVH Box Lift model <sphx_glr_auto_examples_Mocap_plot_BVH_BoxLift.py>` in the AMMR and implements
the trunk exoskeleton concept. In this example, a spring force is applied at the pelvis-thorax extension measure of the body model.
