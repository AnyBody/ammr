Statistical Scaling Plugin
===============================

Plugin for scaling subjects based on an anthropometric database.

This example shows how to use the Statistical Scaling Plugin. The plugin is a
small app which allows you to simply specify a few anatomical or functional
parameters when scaling the model. The plugin calculates the remaining (free)
anthropometric variables based on the ANSUR [#f1]_ anthropometrical database. 

| **Main file:** 
| ``Application/Examples/StandingModelScalingDisplay/StatisticalScalingPlugin/Main.any``

The big advantage is that the correlation between variables are maintained, so
the model will have realistic anthropometrical dimension as long as the
contraints does not conflict (e.g. a very high stature with very short legs )

The algorithm used by the plugin is based on principal component analysis (PCA)
of the correlations between variables in the anthropometric database. An optimization
problem is then solved minimizing the normalized principal component subject to
the anthropometical contraints given by the user. Please see:

.. warning:: The plugin can not be used to generate subjects which are very
     different from the pubulation the ANSUR database. For example children. 


Use the plugin in other models
------------------------------

The plugin can be used in any model as long as it uses the
:ammr:bm_constant:`_SCALING_XYZ_` scaling law. It is also necessary to speciy into
which file the plugin should write the calculated antrhopometrics. This is done
by setting `#path ANSUR_PLUGIN_ANYMAN_FILE` model file which contains the
anthropometics. 

.. code:: AnyScriptDoc

    #define BM_SCALING _SCALING_XYZ_

    #include "<ANYBODY_PATH_AMMR>/Tools/Plugins/ANSUR_Plugin.any"
    #path ANSUR_PLUGIN_ANYMAN_FILE "anthropometics.any"
    
    // Ensure that the generated anthropometrics are
    #include "anthropometics.any"
