# AnyMoCap Features

:::{anylink-gallery} 
:::

A collection of small models that show-off special features of the
*AnyMoCap* framework.

This includes:

* Offset to forceplates.
* Individual cutoff frequencies for markers.
* Normalization with respect to gait cycle events
* Using time-varying weight for markers
* Much more.
