Simple Lower extremity model
===============================

Example of lower body MoCap model using the Plug-in-Gait marker protocol,
and walking on three typ4 force platforms. The model is fairly simple and a
good starting point for new users. If you plan to have many trials/subjects,
take a look at the example which better support multiple trails.
