````{sidebar} **Example**
<img src="/Applications/images/PushUp.jpg" width="70%" align="center">
````


A full-body model doing push-ups with assumed drivers.



:::{seealso}
**Main file location in AMMR:**

{menuselection}`Application --> Examples --> PushUp --> PushUp.main.any`
:::

The model displays several topics

-Block building techniques
-Include files
-Structuring of models using directories

The positions of the hands can be controlled by chaning variables in the file
Environment.any

:::{caution}
The model seems to be too weak for the load applied when doing pushups, this
is a sign that the shoulder needs more adjustments before it becomes reliable
