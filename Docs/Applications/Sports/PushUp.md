A full-body model doing push-ups with assumed drivers.

:::{admonition} In Model Repository:
:class: seealso

{anylink-file}`Application/Examples/PushUp/PushUp.main.any`

:::

The model displays several topics

-Block building techniques
-Include files
-Structuring of models using directories

The positions of the hands can be controlled by chaning variables in the file
Environment.any

:::{caution}
The model seems to be too weak for the load applied when doing pushups, this
is a sign that the shoulder needs more adjustments before it becomes reliable
