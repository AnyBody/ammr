The Wilke Spine Pressure models are eight models that compare intradiscal pressure measured between L4 and L5 discs in different postures.

For the comparison, all data is normalized (100 %) to the forces from *'SpinePressureStanding.Main.any'*  and *'Relaxed Standing'* to show trend validity between the various postures.
