Configuring the Body Model
===========================



AnyBody users can exercise a multitude of choices when defining the anatomy of the AMMR's human body model. These include the the limb segments that must be included in the model, 
degree of model complexity, cadaveric datasets to base the model on etc. This writeup will explain how you can configure the model by specifying these choices. 

**Configuration is set in AnyScript through a number of switches called 
Body Model (BM) parameters. BM parameters are always prefixed with BM_ and written in uppercase.**

Setting the BM parameters can enable or disable body parts, change muscle types, or change other options. 

Simple example
--------------

The example below configures a model with no arms and enables the 3-element Hill muscles model on the legs. 

.. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc
    :emphasize-lines: 1-3

    #define BM_ARM_LEFT OFF
    #define BM_ARM_RIGHT OFF
    #define BM_LEG_MUSCLES_BOTH _MUSCLES_3E_HILL_

    // Now include the HumanModel
    #include "<ANYBODY_PATH_BODY>\HumanModel.any"


.. note:: Some parameters have simple :ammr:bm_constant:`ON`/:ammr:bm_constant:`OFF`
    options, while others have more options. 

The next section shows an overview of what BM statements are available for the different body parts.


BM parameters
--------------------------------

There are body model parameters for configuring each body part, controlling scaling, controlling the default
mannequin drivers (click to see tutorial on :ref:`modelling from scratch <MannequinDriver>`), as well as other global options for the model. 

See the following links for details on BM parameters related to different body parts and modelling options:

    Here is an example for the :ammr:bm_statement:`BM_LEG_MUSCLES_BOTH` parameter:

        .. ammr:bm_statement:: BM_LEG_MUSCLES_BOTH
            :noindex:

            Parameter to define muscle behavior of both right and left leg

            :Default: :ammr:bm_constant:`CONST_MUSCLES_SIMPLE`
            :Example: ``#define BM_LEG_MUSCLES_BOTH CONST_MUSCLES_SIMPLE``
            :Options: - :any:`CONST_MUSCLES_NONE`: Constant to switch off muscles
                    - :any:`CONST_MUSCLES_SIMPLE`: Constant to use simple muscles
                    - :any:`CONST_MUSCLES_3E_HILL`: Constant to use 3 element Hill-type muscle
