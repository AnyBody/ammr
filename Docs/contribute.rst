Contribute to Model Development
-------------------------------

The Model Repository is the product of collaboration between AnyBody Technology,
and many academic institutions and research projects. 

If you are interested in beta models/repositories that have not been integrated
into the AMMR yet, please visit `the development repositories hosted on Github
<https://github.com/anybody>`_. All contributions are most welcome. 

There is also a development version of the AMMR, which is not hosted publically.
Please contact us if you need access to the development version of the AMMR.
