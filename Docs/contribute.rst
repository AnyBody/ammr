Contribute to Model Development
-------------------------------

The Model Repository is the product of collaboration between AnyBody Technology,
and many academic institutions and research projects. 

If you are interested in beta models/repositories you can get access to the
development version of the AMMR. Development takes place in a semi-closed
repository. The repository is closed to protect academic contributors who also
often need to publish their models before release.

However, access to the repository is given on request. Visit the following site
and press “Request Access”.

https://gitlab.com/anybody/beta

You can also view other freely available models and resources hosted on `GitHub
<https://github.com/anybody>`_.
