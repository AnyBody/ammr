Contribute to Model Development
-------------------------------

The Model Repository is the product of collaboration between AnyBody Technology,
and many academic institutions and research projects. 

If you are interested in beta models/repositories you can get access to the
development version of the AMMR. Development takes place in a semi-closed
repository. The repository is closed to protect academic contributors who also
often need to publish their models before release.

However, access is given on request. Please [submit an issue here](https://github.com/AnyBody/ammr-doc/issues), to request access. 

You can also view other freely available models and resources hosted on `GitHub
<https://github.com/anybody>`__.
