# Twente Lower Extremity Model v.2.2

The Twente lower extremity model version 2 (TLEM2) is a successor to the {doc}`TLEM 1
model <leg_tlem_model>`. It contains **6 DOF** and **169
muscles**.

## Example Configuration

muscle model and only one leg:

```


## Background

The model is based on published anatomical data produced from a cadaver study in
the [TLEMsafe EU project](https://tlemsafe.eu/). The first implmentation of
the musculoskeletal model was created by Vincenzo Carbone and René Fluit from
the University of Twente [^cite_cfpk15].

The key feature of TLEM 2 compared to older TLEM 1 model is a consistent
dataset, where both muscle attachement and bone surface scans are from the same
subject. This makes TLEM2 the more anatomically consistent model. Bone contact
at joints such as the knee thus consists of naturally congruent surfaces, making
it easier to implement Force Dependent Kinematics on joint movements ({doc}`see
tutorial <tutorials:ForceDependentKinematics/index>`

The model was refined during the [Life Long Joints
project](https://lifelongjoints.eu/) where its anatomical fidelity and joint
force prediction accuracy were improved by De Pieri et al. [^cite_dlgr17]. 
Mainly by implementing better a wrapping surfaces for the muscles.

Resently, the model have been updated again (Now designated [version
2.2](#TLEM2-v2.2)) with muscle wrapping for the achiles tendon, as well as
updates to the implemenation of the ankle complex in preparation for a new multi
segment foot models.

## History and changes:

(TLEM2-v2.2)=

TLEM v2.2
: :::{versionadded} 2.5.0
  :::
  The foot and talus models have several updates in preparation for the 
  release of advanced multi-segment foot models in the future:  
  - The talus coordinate system is updated to be coincident with the foot 
    coordinate system in the neutral position. This facilitates scaling
    of subject-specific foot models that would normally include the foot 
    and talus in the same coordinate system. For backwards compatibility,
    a new reference node, `TalusCompatibilityFrameAMMR24`, is created in the 
    talus segment. This reference node has the same position and orientation 
    as the previous coordinate system of talus.
  - The update of the talus coordinate system allows reusing some of the 
    parameters from the foot model and simplifies the code. The talus now uses the
    subtalar joint parameters from the foot model. The ankle joint parameters 
    have been updated to be expressed in the new coordinate system. However, 
    both joints are consistent with the previous implementation. 
  - The anatomical frames of the foot and the talus are now defined using bony 
    landmarks on the foot and the lateral and medial malleoli. The vertical axis 
    is defined as the perpendicular to three coplanar points that can be considered 
    parallel to the ground. In the new implementation, these are the lowermost points
    on heel, fifth metatarsal, and medial sesamoid on first metatarsal. This will update 
    the neutral position of the foot and talus. Moreover, this will also affect the 
    ankle plantarflexion and subtalar joint angles.
    :::{warning}
    Ankle and Subtalar joint angle measures are updated. Please
    run `MarkerTracking` again for mocap models if using TLEM 2.2.
    :::
  - The malleoli coordinates in the foot coordinate system have been fixed to 
    match the malleoli on the shank in the neutral position.
  - The model tree has been updated. The talus segment is moved inside the 
    foot segment. For backwards compatibility, a pointer to the talus segment 
    still exists outside the foot segment.


(TLEM2-v2.1)=

TLEM v2.1
: :::{versionadded} 2.0.0
  :::
  Wrapping surfaces for several muscles were updated. These changes were engineered to
  result in realistic muscle coordination and hip contact forces as documented
  in the publication by De Pieri et al. [^cite_dlgr17]
