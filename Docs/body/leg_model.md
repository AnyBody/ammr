# The “Leg” Model

The “Leg” model was the first leg model to enter the AnyBody model
repository. It includes the pelvis, thigh, shank and a one segment foot.
The hip joint is modeled as a spherical joint, while the knee and ankle
are modeled as hinges. The “Leg” model is equipped with only **35 muscles
elements**, which makes it a far simpler model than the LegTLEM.

Thanks to *Mark Thompson*, Lund University Hospital, for his help in
developing the lower extremity model. A couple of muscles with broad
insertions (like the m. gluteus maximus) are divided into multiple
individual muscle units to represent the real geometry and the
mechanical actions of the muscle.

The parameters of these muscles are mainly based on the data published
by Delp and Maganaris
