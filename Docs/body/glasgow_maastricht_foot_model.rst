The Glasgow-Maastricht Foot Model (GM Foot)
===========================================


.. rst-class:: without-title

.. caution:: **Unreleased model:** The model is under development and not yet included in the managed model repository. 
    An updated version of the Glasgow-Maastricht Foot model 
    is under development, and used in various research projects. 
    See the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/AnyBody/gm-foot>`__ for more info.

    Access to the model can be given on request. so please 
    `contact us <sales@anybodytech.com>`_ if you are interested in this work. 


AnyBody Technology developed in corporation with Glasgow Caledonian
University and University of Maastricht inside the `AFootprint EU project <http://www.afootprint.eu/>`_ 
a detailed multisegmental foot model, which is fully dynamic and
contains 26 segments representing all the foot bones, muscles,
ligaments, and joints connecting them.

The model can be used with the
anatomy and recorded motion from different subjects. It has been through 
a validation process comparing it with other experimental and computational studies.

.. warning:: **Complex model:** The GM Foot model is very complex and not recommended for
    beginners in musculoskeletal modeling and AnyBody.




Usage:
---------------

The model can added to the TLEM 2.0 leg model and requires AMMR 2.0.1 or later. 

To use the GM foot model the file GM_Foot_libdef.any must be included before the first Main statement.

.. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc

   // Include before the first Main
   #include "path/to/GM_Foot/GM_Foot_libdef.any"

   Main = {

      // Add body model configuration. E.g.
      #define BM_ARM_RIGHT OFF
      #define BM_ARM_LEFT OFF

      // Include the GM foot model. It handles inlcuding the human model as well.
      #include "<GM_FOOT_PATH>/GM_foot_model.any"




Model structure
----------------


The foot model includes 26 rigid segments representing all the bones of
the human foot (except the sesamoid bones), namely:

   Talus, Calcaneus,
   Cuboid, Navicular, Medial cuneiform, Intermediate cuneiform, Lateral
   cuneiform, First metatarsal, Second metatarsal, Third metatarsal, Fourth
   metatarsal, Fifth metatarsal, First proximal phalange, First distal
   phalange, Second proximal phalange, Second medial phalange, Second
   distal phalange, Third proximal phalange, Third medial phalange, Third
   distal phalange, Fourth proximal phalange, Fourth medial phalange,
   Fourth distal phalange, Fifth proximal phalange, Fifth medial phalange,
   Fifth distal phalange.

It includes the following joints and kinematic constraints:

   *Talocrural*  *and Subtalar joint [20],*  *Talonavicular joint,*
   *Calcaneocuboid joint,*  *Medialcuneonavicular joint,*
   *Intermediate and lateral cuneonavicular joints,*  *First
   tarsometatarsal joint,*  *Second, third and fourth tarsometatarsal
   joints,*  *Fifth tarsometatarsal joint,*  *Metatarsophalangeal
   joints,*  *Interphalangeal joints,*  *Toe flexion rhythm,*
   *Intertarsal contact,*  *Metatarsal head contact,*  *Metatarsal
   transverse arch,*  *Tarsal transverse arch,*  *Longitudinal medial
   arch,*  *Longitudinal lateral arch.*

The GM-Foot model includes following additional ligaments: 

   Collateral
   (tibiotalar anterior, tibiotalar posterior, tibiocalcaneal and
   tibionavicular, and the lateral group constituted of the talofibular
   anterior, talofibular posterior and talocalcaneal), Deep metatarsal
   transverse, Plantar fascia, Long plantar, Calcaneo cuboid plantar,
   Calcaneo navicular plantar, Tarsal ligaments ( Talonavicular dorsal,
   Bifurcate, Calcaneocuboid dorsal, Cuneonavicular dorsal 1, 2 and 3,
   Cuneonavicular plantar 1, 2 and 3, Intercuneiform dorsal 1 and 2,
   Cuneocuboid dorsal, Intercuneiform plantar 1 and 2, Cuneocuboid plantar,
   Cuboideonavicular dorsal, Cuboideonavicular plantar, Tarsometatarsal
   dorsal 1 to 8, Tarsometatarsal plantar 1 to 7, Intermetatarsal dorsal 1,
   2 and 3, Intermetatarsal plantar 1, 2 and 3) and Phalangeal ligaments

The muscles of the foot can be divided into two groups: the intrinsic
muscles and the extrinsic muscles. All the extrinsic muscles come from
the TLEM leg model of the AMMR. The intrinsic foot musculature is
constituted of the following muscles:

   abductor hallucis (ABDH), flexor hallucis brevis medialis (FHBM) and
   lateralis (FHBL), adductor hallucis transverse (ADHT) and oblique
   (ADHO), abductor digiti minimi (ABDM), flexor digiti minimi brevis
   (FDMB), dorsal interosseous (DI), plantar interosseous (PI), flexor
   digitorum brevis (FDB), lumbricals (LB), quadratus plantar medialis
   (QPM) and lateralis (QPL), extensor hallucis brevis (EHB), extensor
   digitorum brevis (EDB)

   This webcast presents a detailed AnyBody musculoskeletal foot model
   which includes all bones and joints of a real foot. Developed in
   collaboration with Glasgow Caledonian University and University
   Hospital Maastricht and referred to as the "Glasgow-Maastricht foot
   model" this model can be driven by motion capture data and uses
   combined force plate/pressure plate for accurate loading of the
   different joints. Built-in scaling allows the user to reproduce
   principal foot deformities such as flat foot and hallux valgus. The
   high detail level of the model and a built-in scaling protocol allows
   the user to investigate a wide range of parameters like joints motion
   and load, muscles activation, both in healthy and pathologic feet.
