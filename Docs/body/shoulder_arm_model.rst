The Shoulder Arm Model
======================

The ShoulderArm model contains data from two different persons. Most of this data
comes from the Dutch Shoulder Group and their 
`shoulder model available online 
<http://homepage.tudelft.nl/g6u61/repository/shoulder/overview.htm>`_

.. todo:: What is the VU and MAYO study shown below? Need to add references?

.. versionadded:: 2.2
    A new wrapping implementation of the deltoid muscles was recently added by Marta Strzelczak from 
    École de technologie supérieure, Montreal, CA. See :ref:`DeltoidWrapping` below.


The model is built using data from subject 2 from the VU study and subject 2
from the MAYO study. The files, which contains the name "forearm", are
built on data from the MAYO study

The shoulder is the site of complex, mutually coupled motions of the scapula,
clavicle and the humerus. To balance realism with model simplicity, the model 
defines motions of the scapula and clavicle as mathematical functions of the 
glenohumeral joint angles, also known as a "Shoulder rhythms".

The AnyBody shoulder model's rhythm can be switched on
and off, the full details of which can be seen in this report
`Shoulder Rhythm
Report <https://www.anybodytech.com/download.html?did=publications.files&fname=ShoulderRhythmReport.pdf>`__.

Example Configuration
-----------------------

Short example of how to configure the Shoulder Arm model: 

.. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc

    #define BM_ARM_RIGHT ON 
    #define BM_ARM_LEFT ON 
    #define BM_ARM_SHOULDER_RHYTHM ON

    #define BM_ARM_MUSCLE _MUSCLES_3E_HILL_
    


.. rst-class:: float-right

.. seealso::
   
   See :doc:`Arm configuration parameters <../bm_config/arm>` for a
   full list of configuration parmaeters or :doc:`configuration section <../bm_config/index>`
   for more information on BM parameters.



The model consists of the following joints:

.. _DeltoidWrapping:

Deltoid wrapping
-----------------

A new implementation of the deltoid muscles have been added. The implementation
uses multiple wrapping cylinders for each element of the deltoid muscle. The new
approach ensures a more realistic path of the muscle fibers compared to the
previous implementaiton which used a dedicated rake segment to hold the detoid
fibers in place.

New deltoid wrapping can be disabled/enabled with the switch
:ammr:bm_statement:`BM_ARM_DELTOID_WRAPPING`. 

The new deltoid wrapping was developed by Marta Strzelczak from Département de
génie de la production automatisée, École de technologie supérieure, Montreal,
CA. Please cite the following work if you need it: 

   Strzelczak, M., Lund, M. E., Sins, L., Mickael, B. & Hagemeister, N. A new
   wrapping approach for the deltoid muscle modelling. in The Proceedings of the
   20th Biennial Meeting of theCanadian Society for Biomechanics (2018).



Degrees of freedom
------------------

The arm has the following basic dof, which can be controlled by combinations
joint drivers directly or indirectly through connections to the environment

* SternoClavicularProtraction
* SternoClavicularElevation
* SternoClavicularAxialRotation

* GlenohumeralFlexion 
* GlenohumeralAbduction
* GlenohumeralExternalRotation

* ElbowFlexion
* ElbowPronation

* WristFlexion 
* WristAbduction
