# The Symmetric Mandible

% Are there more stuff we can write about the mandle model.
% I think we should also add more images.

This mandible model is based on CT scans of a ”normal” face of a
30-year-old male. It contains 24 hill-type muscles and 4 DoF. It was
developed by Dr. Mark de Zee at Aarhus University, Denmark and
[published](http://www.anybodytech.com/downloads/publications/?fwd=publications#zee2007)
and presented at several scientific meetings. [^cite_dezee2007]
