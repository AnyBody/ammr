# The Shoulder Arm Model

The ShoulderArm model contains data from two different persons. Most of this data
comes from the Dutch Shoulder Group and their
[shoulder model available online](https://web.archive.org/web/20150707202425/http://homepage.tudelft.nl/g6u61/repository/shoulder/overview.htm)


:::{versionadded} 2.2
A new wrapping implementation of the deltoid muscles was added by Marta Strzelczak from École de technologie supérieure, Montreal, CA. See {ref}`DeltoidWrapping` below.
:::

The model is built using data from subject 2 from the VU study and subject 2
from the MAYO study. The files, which contains the name "forearm", are
built on data from the MAYO study.

The shoulder is a complex joint with mutually coupled motions of the scapula,
clavicle and the humerus. To balance realism with model simplicity, the model
defines motions of the scapula and clavicle as mathematical functions of the
glenohumeral joint angles, also known as a "Shoulder rhythms".

The AnyBody shoulder model's rhythm can be switched on
and off, the full details of which can be seen in this report
[Shoulder Rhythm
Report](https://paperpile.com/shared/sQXLyvQsQRfauvB5T9lxyqg).

## Example Configuration

Short example of how to configure the Shoulder Arm model:

```AnyScriptDoc
#define BM_ARM_RIGHT ON
#define BM_ARM_LEFT ON
#define BM_ARM_SHOULDER_RHYTHM ON

#define BM_ARM_MUSCLE _MUSCLES_3E_HILL_
```

## Deltoid wrapping

An wrapping implementation of the deltoid muscles have been added after the
model was first built. The implementation uses multiple wrapping cylinders for
each element of the deltoid muscle. The new approach ensures a more realistic
path of the muscle fibers compared to the previous implementaiton which used a
dedicated rake segment to hold the detoid fibers in place.

Deltoid wrapping can be disabled/enabled with the switch
{ammr:bm_statement}`BM_ARM_DELTOID_WRAPPING`.

The deltoid wrapping was developed by Marta Strzelczak from Département de
génie de la production automatisée, École de technologie supérieure, Montreal,
CA. Please cite the following work if you need it:

## Degrees of freedom

The arm has the following basic dof, which can be controlled by combinations
joint drivers directly or indirectly through connections to the environment

- SternoClavicularProtraction
- SternoClavicularElevation
- SternoClavicularAxialRotation
- GlenohumeralFlexion
- GlenohumeralAbduction
- GlenohumeralExternalRotation
- ElbowFlexion
- ElbowPronation
- WristFlexion
- WristAbduction

## Joint terminology


The model consists of the following joints:

**Joints and kinematic contraints of the arm model**
