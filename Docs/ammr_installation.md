# Installing Latest AMMR Files

Here you can find the guide to install the latest AMMR files. The files will
be located locally, in the Documents folder of each user on your computer.
If there are multiple users using your computer, each of them will have to
follow this guide.

**STEP 1**

To get a fresh copy of the AMMR select the "Demo" tab in the AnyBody Assistant
window that opens when AnyBody starts:

```{image} _static/Installation-anybodyassistent.png
:align: center
:width: 400
```

```{rst-class} centered
```

**STEP 2**

Then select the "Install demo repository..."

```{image} _static/Installation-demo-repo.png
:align: center
:width: 400
```

This installs the repository into your Documents folder (e.g. {{ AMMR_DEMO_INST_DIR }}). You
may keep this files safe on your computer by copying them to another location. There you
can initialise a git repository in which you can version you models, keep a backup or
share them easily with the community.

:::{warning}
As written before, AnyBody Modelling System comes with a version of AMMR
(not necessarily the latest) which you can find in the installation folder of the
software. Do not use these files for your actual work unless you copy them somewhere
else. There is a risk to lose your changes in case AnyBody is reinstalled or updated.
You can use these files safely by copying them in your work folder.
