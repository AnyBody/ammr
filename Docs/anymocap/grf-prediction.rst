Ground Reaction force prediction
################################

Background
============================

Motion capture data is often recorded without force plates. In traditional
inverse dynamics, this would make it impossible to perform a dynamic analysis.
However, AnyBody has the possibility to predict ground reaction forces (GRF), so
you can make inverse dynamics models based on recorded motion without GRF force
measurement (Fluit et al., 2014; Jung et al., 2014).

GRF prediction relies on conditional contacts added to the feet of the model.
The conditional contacts work as force actuators to generate the normal and
frictional forces necessary to balance model. Mathematically, the actuators are
modeled similarly to muscles, and the muscle recruitment optimization determines
the contact forces. The effect is that the model will utilize the ground
reactions if that can minimize the muscle activity.

Adding conditional contacts to a model can be rather complex, but we have
created an AnyScript class template that makes the process much easier. The
class template will generate all the necessary AnyScript code. Thus, adding GRF
prediction is similar to adding force plates to a model.

This new functionality is now part of the AnyBody Managed Model Repository
(AMMR).


Adding ground force prediction to a model
===============================================

The :ref:`GRF example model <sphx_glr_auto_examples_MoCap_plot_Plug-in-gait_Simple_FullBody_GRFPrediction.py>` 
is already preconfigured to use the GRF prediction. But
if you need to add GRF prediction to new model the following outlines the
procedure. 

Including the class templates
-----------------------------

The class template is already included in the AnyMoCap framework, so this step
can be skipped. However, when using GRF prediction in other models it is
necessary to include the following line at the beginning of the model:

.. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc

    #include "<ANYBODY_PATH_AMMR>/Tools/GRFPrediction/FootPlateConditionalContact.any"


Adding the GRF prediction classes
----------------------------------

In the AnyMoCap models GRF prediction is enabled by setting the following
setting: 

.. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc

    #define MOCAP_USE_GRF_PREDICTION ON

The next step is to add the class template to generate the AnyScript code for
GRF prediction. These classes replaces the Force plate classes in the AnyMoCap
model. 

.. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc

    // EXCLUDE THE EXISTING C3D FORCE PLATES
    // ForcePlateAutoDetection Plate1(
    //    PLATE_NO=1,
    //     HeightTolerance = 0.07,
    //    VelThreshold = 2.2,
    //    FORCEPLATE_TYPE = 4,
    //   ALLOW_MULTI_LIMB_CONTACT = OFF
    // ) = { };


    FootPlateConditionalContact GRF_Prediction_Right(
        NORMAL_DIRECTION = "Y",
        NUMBER_OF_NODES = 25,
        NODES_FOLDER = FootNodes, 
        PLATE_BASE_FRAME = Main.EnvironmentModel.GlobalRef
    ) = {
        CreateFootContactNodes25 FootNodes(
            foot_ref=Main.HumanModel.BodyModel.Right.Leg.Seg.Foot
        ) = {};
    };


See below for more information on the GRF prediction classes.

Setting up new residuals (Hand of God)
---------------------------------------

Adding conditional contacts to the feet is not enough. The AnyMoCap model comes
reactions forces applied to the pelvis. These are the reactions that carry any
inconsistencies between the model and force plate data, and they must be removed
for ground reaction force prediction. 

Instead, we apply another type of residuals to the model, so the solver does not
fail if the model fails to balance. These residuals are implemented as
recruitment actuators from pelvis to the global reference frame. These actuators
are implemented similarly to how muscles work. However, they are very weak, so
the recruitment solver will only activate them if nothing else can balance the
model.

In the AnyMoCap models the new residuals are activated by default when
``MOCAP_USE_GRF_PREDICTION`` is set to ``ON``. So no need to do anything.

In other models the Weak residuals must be added manually, or by including the
following file in your model: 

.. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc

    Main.ModelEnvironmentConnection  = {
        #include "<ANYBODY_PATH_AMMR>/Tools/GRFPrediction/WeakResiduals.any"
    };


The file ``WeakResiduals.any`` does the job of removing the ‘Hand of God’ and adding
the new, weak residuals. Again this is handled automatically in the AnyMoCap
based models. 

Running the model
=================

The model is run in the same way as other models. The only difference is that it
now uses GRF prediction instead of force plates data.

.. figure:: /anymocap/grf_output.png
    :align: center

It may be necessary to adjust the parameters of the GRF prediction class to
obtain a good prediction of the ground reactions. This is especially important
around heel strike and toe-off, where the model can have problems. 

GRF prediction trouble shooting
=======================================

Here are some things to check if a GRF prediction model fails running inverse
dynamic:

* Direction of gravity is it specified correctly?  this needs to be correct in
  two places the Gravity property of the study in the LabSpecific.any data and in
  the definition of the force plates setting the variable ``NORMAL_DIRECTION``. 

* In the file Forceplate_GRFprediction.any try to increase the property ``LimitDistHigh``,
  this controls when contact can occur so if the number is higher the foot do
  not need to be as close to the ground before contact can occur, see also
  LimitVelHigh it controls speed limit.

* Unrealistic accelerations of the model could be the reason if your data are
  not filtered correctly

* The model is using a weak residual to the ground that helps holding the balance 
  in the model if the feet contact are not enough, this is defined in  the file
  "Tools/GRFPrediction/Weakresidual.any" here  you can increase the strength
  of the artificial muscles, but this will lead to higher residuals so be
  careful.


A closer look at the GRF template
=================================

Finally, we can take a closer look at the ``FootPlateConditionalContact`` template. 

.. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc

    FootPlateConditionalContact GRF_Prediction_Right(
        NORMAL_DIRECTION = "Y",
        NUMBER_OF_NODES = 25,
        NODES_FOLDER = FootNodes, 
        PLATE_BASE_FRAME = Main.EnvironmentModel.GlobalRef
    ) = {
        CreateFootContactNodes25 FootNodes(
            foot_ref=Main.HumanModel.BodyModel.Right.Leg.Seg.Foot
        ) = {};
    };

It consists of two parts; a top level class template
(``FootPlateConditionalContact``) that generate the conditional-contact code.
This code needs a few important arguments. The ground plane
(``PLATE_BASE_FRAME``) is a reference system where the ground plane is located.

Together with arguments ``NORMAL_DIRECTION`` this specifies the surface the
model is walking on. Another important argument is the ``NODES_FOLDER``, which
is a folder that contains all the contacts points.

The contact points can be created manually, but to avoid this we use another
class-template (``CreateFootContactNodes25``) to create the nodes automatically.
As the name says it creates 25 nodes in the foot coordinate system. This part is
specific to the model implementation. One could also imagine class-templates
that produce a higher number of nodes or nodes in positions that corresponds to
particular shoes or on other body parts.

Of course, there are also many options that can be tweaked and adjusted.
