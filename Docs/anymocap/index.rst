doing any kind of mocap analysis with the `AnyBody Modeling
System <http://anybodytech.com>`__.

Over determinate kinematic analysis
*************************************

Musculoskeletal models that use Motion capture data are different from other
types of models found the AMMR.  Most importantly, MOCAP models usually require
an over-determinate kinematic solver to handle the excess in information that
the optical markers provide. 

The over-determinate solver in AMS works great, but
it can only find velocities and accelerations numerically. That has some
performance issue when running inverse dynamics analysis. To overcome the
problem, the MOCAP analysis is split into a two-step procedure, as illustrated on
the figure below:

.. _AnyMoCap-flow-figure:

.. figure:: /Applications/Mocap/anymocap_flow.png

   Figure 1: The framework of the AnyMoCap model. Analysis is split into three
   steps. *Parameter identification*, *Marker tracking*, *Inverse dynamic
   analysis*.


The over determinate kinematic analysis solves the model for positions, and
writes joint angles to a a set of files. These joint angles can then be used
with the determinate kinematic solver in the inverse dynamic analysis.

    :doc:`AnyMoCap model <tutorials:Making_things_move/lesson5>`


AnyMoCap examples
***********************

The following gallery shows different examples using the AnyMoCap framework. 

.. include:: /auto_examples/backreferences/gallery.anymocap.examples
.. raw:: html

    <div style='clear:both'></div>

.. note:: The *Multi trial MoCap model* is likely the best starting point when
          working with many trials/subjects from a MoCap experiment. 


.. rst-class:: emphasize-children

Get started 
**********************

The easiest way to get started, is to adapt one the example application above. 

A typical application using the AnyMoCap framework will look something like this:

.. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc
   :linenos:

    #include "../libdef.any"

    #path MOCAP_TRIAL_SPECIFIC_DATA "TrialSpecificData.any"
    #path MOCAP_SUBJECT_SPECIFIC_DATA "SubjectSpecificData.any"
    #path MOCAP_LAB_SPECIFIC_DATA "LabSpecificData.any"

    // Include the AnyMoCap Framwork
    #include "<ANYMOCAP_MODEL>"

You can place this main file anywhere on your computer as long the
``libdef.any`` file points to model repository (AMMR) you want to use. 

.. caution:: It is recommended *not* to place working models inside the AMMR folder.
             Copy the example elsewhere before using.

Options and settings
***************************

The ``Main.ModelSetup`` folder contains the main machinery of the *AnyMoCap*
framework. It is controlled by a number of settings both ``#define``/``#path`` switches
and variables which can be set directly. For example: 


.. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc

    #define MOCAP_INPUT_DATA_TYPE "C3D"

    Main.ModelSetup.TrialSpecificData.LastFrame = 240; 


The following two sections gives an overview of the settings available:

Paths settings and switches
-------------------------------

Path settings and switches are usually prefixed by ``MOCAP_`` to indicate that
they are specific to the AnyMoCap framework.

Configurable variables 
-----------------------------

The ``Main.ModelSetup`` folder contains all the machinery of the AnyMoCap
framework. It has three important subfolder (``TrialSpecificData``,
``SubjectSpecificData`` and ``LabSpecificData``).

.. figure:: model-setup-structure.png

 These three folders contain variables specific to the application but also has
 a few variables which can be assigned directly by the user.
