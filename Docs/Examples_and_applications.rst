Application examples
=============================

In the repository, you can find following 3 subdivisions under
applications:

-  **Examples** contain several musculoskeletal applications from a wide
   area of interests. These models are from various AnyBody users, and
   all demonstrate features from the AnyBody Modeling System. All
   examples are powerful computational models where most results have
   been biomechanically checked if they make sense, however, in
   particular when changes to the models will be made, results may occur
   that cannot be interpreted by anatomical or physiological
   considerations:

   -  **Orthopedic and Rehab applications:**

      -  **Spine Fixation Model using Force Dependent Kinematics:** This
         application is an example of how to use the new force-dependent
         kinematics. The force dependent kinematics allows the kinematic
         spine rhythm which normally drives the vertebras to be switched
         entirely off.

      -  **Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) Model:** Model of a total hip
         replacement using a contact implant model and force-dependent
         kinematics (FDK).

      -  **Wheel Chair Model:** A model of a person sitting in a
         wheelchair, the model is driven by motion capture data.

      -  **Facet Joint Model:** A spine model with facet joints.

   -  **Sports application:**

      -  **Cross Trainer Model:** This model is based on a SolidWorks
         CAD model of a cross trainer fitness machine extended with the
         human.This model is also the subject of the AnyBody Tutorial
         called "Making Models using SolidWorks".

      -  **Leg Press Machine:** A model illustrating a leg press
         exercise and it demonstrates the use of the SolidModeling Class
         Template in the ToolBox of AMMR.

      -  **Bike Model:** Bicycle rider model that runs either as
         FullBody or as LowerExtremity version.

      -  **2D Bike Model:** A simple bicycle rider model using a planar
         leg model.

      -  **Push-up Model:** A full-body model doing push-ups with
         assumed drivers.

      -  **Bench Press Model:** A full-body model doing push-ups with
         assumed drivers.

   -  **Daily Activities:**

      -  **Free Posture Model:** A full-body model that is easy to put
         into specific static postures. It is equipped with drivers on
         intuitive anatomical joint angle and by default without
         muscles.

      -  **Standing Model:** A basic static full-body model standing on
         a floor.

      -  **MOCAP Model:** Full body or LowerExtremity gait model based
         on motion capture data. There are three different versions
         available using input data (C3D files) recorded in different
         gait labs from different subjects, marker protocols, and force
         plate types:

         -  MOCAP: Recorded in the Gait Lab of Aalborg University with a
            Qualisys system and 4 type4 force plates

         -  MOCAP Runner: Recorded in Shanghai University of Sports with
            a Vicon system using 2 type3 force plates

         -  MOCAP UniMiami: Recorded in Uni Miami with a Vicon system
            using 4 type3 force plates

      -  **Lifting Model:** Standing body model lifting a box.

      -  **Hand Pump:** Model of a person operating an old-fashioned
         pump by hand. The model is based on the standing model.

   -  **Automotive/Aerospace application:**

      -  **Seated Human:** A model of a seated human consisting of the
         full body model, a chair, and an interface between the two.

      -  **Pedal Demo Model:** A leg pressing down a pedal. This
         demonstrates conditional contact between the foot and the
         pedal.

      -  **Egress:** Egress from an automobile. This model simulates an
         egress movement from where the occupant has just left the
         support of the seat and until he or she is standing up.

      -  **Simple Pedal Demo:** This model demonstrates the construction
         of a foot pedal example.

-  **Beta** contains some applications that have not been extensively
   tested yet by AnyBody. However, they show fascinating features and
   are therefore provided for all users.

   -  **Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) Model (BETA):** Demo example of a
      total knee replacement using contact forces on the implant and
      force-dependent kinematics (FDK).

   -  **John Wu finger model:** Model from a finger with muscles only,
      there is no attachment to the rest of the body, not even the hand.
      This model was kindly provided by John Wu.

   -  **Cow:** Model of a cow leg.

-  **Validation:** This folder includes some models from users that show
   how certain aspects of the models have been validated versus in vivo
   measured data:

   -  **Gait Vaughan:** Gait model based on data from the book by
      Vaughan et al. comparing AnyBody predicted muscle activations with
      EMG measurements.

   -  **Mandible Chewing Model:** Model simulating chewing and comparing
      values to measurements from de Zee et al., J. of Biomechanics
      2007.

   -  **Wilke Spine Disc Pressure Model:** Several models comparing
      loads in the spine with in vivo measurements during daily
      activities from Wilke et al., Spine 1999.

   -  **Bergmann GH:** Model simulating arm-lift motion adapted from
      Bergmann et al., J. of Biomechanics 2007 to compare the results to
      in vivo measurements from that study.
