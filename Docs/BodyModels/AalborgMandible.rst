The Aalborg mandible
----------------------------

This is a mandible model based on a CT scan of a 40 year old male.

The model was developed for two purposes:

1 Demonstration of how to apply force-dependent kinematics (FDK) for modeling of
  the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) 

2 Validation of the predicted mandible kinematics with the FDK TMJ model and
  comparison to a simpler point-on-plane (POP) model.

You can read more about this model and the validation in [AZDN17]_

The work was supported by the Sapere Aude program of the Danish Council for
Independent Research under grant number: DFF‐4184‐00018.

   example of how the model is used.
