The Shoulder Arm Model
----------------------

This model contains data from two different persons. Most of the data
that has been used in this model comes from the Dutch Shoulder Group and
can be found on the following webpage
http://homepage.tudelft.nl/g6u61/repository/shoulder/overview.htm . The
model is built using data from subject 2 from the VU study and subject 2
from the MAYO study. The files, which contains the name "forearm", are
built on data from the MAYO study

A shoulder rhythm is available in the repository it can be switched on
and off, for full details on its implementation please see this report
`Shoulder Rhythm
Report <https://www.anybodytech.com/download.html?did=publications.files&fname=ShoulderRhythmReport.pdf>`__.

*The model consists of the following joints:*

-  SC SternoClavicular: spherical joint

-  AC AcromioClavicular: spherical joint

-  GH Glenohumeral joint: spherical (normal reactions of the spherical
   joint is not used instead they are created so that they fall within
   the glenoid cavity the file, please see the file GHReactions.any for
   details)

-  AI One dimensional constraint between the scapula and the thorax at
   the bonylandmark AI om scapula

-  AA One dimensional constraint between the scapula and the thorax at
   the bonylandmark AA om scapula

-  ConoideumLigamentÂ : the length of this segment is driven to a
   constant length

-  FE Flexion-extension of the elbow: revolute joint

-  PS pronation-supination joint or the forearm: combination of joints
   in distal and proximal end of the radius bone that leaves one dof
   free which is pronation/supination of the forearm

-  Wrist joint: created as two revolute joints where the axis of
   rotations are not coincident
