AMMR 2.2 beta (2018-??-??)
**************************

  .. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1481635.svg
    :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1481635



  **Added:**

  * Added two new default arguments (``MANNEQUIN_FOLDER``, ``BODYMODEL_FOLDER``) to  the
    class_template ``Template_MannequinDrivers``, making it easier to reuse the class
    template as a general-purpose driver for all joint angles.
  * New model plugin (BodyModel Configurator) which provides a graphical user interface
    to configure the Body Model (i.e. setting the ``BM_*`` parameters). Please see
    the `blog post <https://anyscript.org/tools/body-model-configurator/>`__
    introducing the BM plugin.
  * New measures for shoulder angles based on recommendation from International Society of Biomechanics (ISB)
    (`Wu et al. 2005`_). The measures are available in the  
    ``BodyModel.Interface`` folder. The new measures are:
    
    * ``AcromioClavicular`` - ``Protraction``, ``MedialRotation``, ``PosteriorTilt``. (section 2.4.3)
    * ``ScapulaHumerus``- ``PlaneOfElevation``, ``Elevation``, ``InternalAxialRotation``. (section 2.4.4)
    * ``ThoraxScapula``- ``Protraction``, ``MedialRotation``, ``PosteriorTilt``. (section 2.4.6)
    * ``ThoraxHumerus``- ``PlaneOfElevation``, ``Elevation``, ``InternalAxialRotation``. (section 2.4.7)
 
.. _Wu et al. 2005: https://isbweb.org/images/documents/standards/Wu%20et%20al%20J%20Biomech%2038%20(2005)%20981%E2%80%93992.pdf

  * New implementation of the Deltoid muscles that uses wrapping instead of previous rake-segment/via-point approach.
    The new wrapping deltoid was developed by Marta Strzelczak from 
    Ecole de technologie superieure, Montreal, CA. The new implementation is used by default but the old 
    implementation can be enabled with the :ammr:bm_statement:`BM_ARM_DELTOID_WRAPPING` switch. Please see the 
    :ref:`Shoulder-arm Documentation <DeltoidWrapping>` for more information.  

  * Markers in MoCap models now changes color to gray when they drop out (i.e. have a weight of zero). 
  * Added new ``ASIS``/``PSIS``/``PT`` bony-landmark nodes to the ``PelvisSeg.Right``/``Left`` folders.
    This ensures the bony landmarks are easily available as nodes in all models
    even if the legs are not included.
  * Three new BM switches to control add default drivers for the individual neck degress of freedom 
    (:bm_statement:`BM_MANNEQUIN_DRIVER_SKULL_THORAX_FLEXION`, 
    :bm_statement:`BM_MANNEQUIN_DRIVER_SKULL_THORAX_LATERALBENDING`,
    :bm_statement:`BM_MANNEQUIN_DRIVER_SKULL_THORAX_ROTATION`)
  * Added a new setting (``#define MOCAP_FILTER_JOINT_ANGLES ON/OFF``) to the AnyMoCap frame work. If enabled a
    filter will be applied to the intermediate set of joint angles generated by the Marker Tracking step. This 
    can be useful to remove high accelerations due to kinematic limit constraints 
    (e.g. Joint angle limits, surface contacts etc.).
  * Added a ``PreAnalysis`` step to the video recorder template (``CameraClassTemplate.any``).
    Operations placed in the ``PreAnalysis`` step will be executed before the video recorder starts. 
  * Added a new warning if using low-pass filters in the AnyMoCap model without a zero phase filter 
    (e.g. warn if  ``FilterForwardBackwardOnOff`` is set to ``Off``)
  * New ``DEFAULT_PARAMETERS_FOLDER`` class template for creating folders with default values
    which can be overridden. See the following example:

    .. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc

      DEFAULT_PARAMETERS_FOLDER Settings( 
          NPARAM = 2,
          VAR1 = TibialRotation, VAR2_TYPE = AnyMat33,
          VAR2 = Offset, VAR2_TYPE = AnyVar
      ) = {
          // Default values are specified with _default_ prefix.
          AnyMat33 _default_TibialRotation = RotMat(5*pi/180,y);
          AnyVar _default_Offset = 0.005;
      };

      // Parameters can now be overridden if desired.
      Settings.TibialRotation = RotMat(10*pi/180,y);


  **Changed:**

  * Scaling law :ammr:bm_constant:`_SCALING_XYZ_` now has a scaling factors to
    control the neck scaling. Before neck scaling controlled by
    the head scale factors.
  * Re-implemented the origins for the Semitendinosus and Biceps Caput Longum muscles in the
    TLEM-2.1 model based on the original digitized insertions and MRI scans. Better
    correspondence with the original MRI scans increases the moment-arms through
    range of motion.
  * New wrapping surfaces for Semitendinosus and Biceps Caput Longum muscles based on orginal MRI scans. 
    New surfaces ensure taht muscles don't penetrate the pelvis bone at high hip flexion angles.
  * Reimplement insertion of Gluteus Medius/Minimus of the TLEM2.1 model based
    on original TLEM2 dataset. This improves range of motion in which Gluteus
    Medius and Gluteus Minimus has a moment arm for internal rotation of the hip.
  * Kinematic rhythms for the shoulder, lumber-spine and cervical-spine are now soft by default. This only 
    has an effect when using the over-determinate kinematic solver and it can be controlled by using
    :bm_statement:`BM_ARM_SHOULDER_RHYTHM_SOFT` and :bm_statement:`BM_TRUNK_RHYTHM_SOFT`. 
  * The MoCap models now use joint angles for all degrees of freedom when transferring 
    motion from MarkerTracking study to the Inverse dynamic study. This means that rhythms can now be 
    soft constraints when running the Marker tracking study, and markers can override the kinematic 
    rhythms if needed.
  * All examples now have their body model configuration in a separate file
    (usually, ``BodyModelConfiguration.any``) to accommodate the new Body Model
    Configurator plugin.
  * Refactored all examples to avoid the confusing paradigm with a reference called ``Model.HumanModel`` 
    pointing to ``HumanModel.BodyModel``.
  * Improvements to the accuracy of the wrapping cylinder used by Teres minor and teres major.
  * The interface morphing algorithm (which morphs pelvis of the trunk or leg dataset to match)
    now includes the ASIS/PSIS/PT bony landmarks as control points. This change ensures that
    bony-landmarks of the Trunk and Leg datasets map to the exact same point.
  * All MoCap model examples now use the option (``UseC3DWeightResiduals=ON``) in the marker protocols.
    This ensures that the marker weights are reduced to zero when a marker drops out (i.e. when the residual value in
    the C3D file becomes negative).

  **Fixed:**
  
  * Fixed typo in ``Flexor_Digitorum_Profundus_Digit5`` name.
  * Fixed problem with the initial guess for Vastus wrapping which could cause
    the Vastus muscle to wrap incorrectly when the knee started in slightly over
    stretched posture. 
  * Fixed an interpolation issue with BVH based AnyMoCap models when the models
    were using all frames in a BVH file. 
  * Fixed the initial wrapping guess for Teres Minor to prevent incorrect wrapping when
    starting model in postures which are close to range of motion.
  * Fixed an issue with over constraint default mannequin drivers when shoulder
    rhythm was enabled. Now the default mannequin drivers will not create
    drivers for sterno-clavicular rotation, elevation, protraction when the
    shoulder rhythm is enabled. 
  * Added hand length/breadth values needed by Detailed Hand to the ``CustomScaling.any`` for custom scaling scenarios
  * Fixed missing possibility for overriding the reaction forces for the Trunk flexion/extension/rotation 
    drivers in ``HumanModel.DefaultMannequinDrivers``.
  * Add missing strength scaling factor to ``pectoralis_major_thoracic_part_3`` in the simple muscle configuration.  
  * Fixed issue with the :ref:`Standing Model example <sphx_glr_auto_examples_ADLs_and_ergonomics_plot_StandingModel.py>`,
    where the elbow flexion velocity was incorrectly set to a non zero value.
  * Fixed the problem with over-constraint models when adding the 
    shoulder rhythm.
  * Fixed a problem with the FullBody AnyMoCap example where a relative high weight
    on the soft clavicula rotation contraints could cause the model to fail
    kinematically in with the AnyBody Modeling System 7.2.

  **Removed:**

  * Removed outdated versions of ``JointLimits_template.any`` and ``KinLimitsDriver_template.any`` from the AnyMoCap folder.
    Updated version of the files still exists in the ``Tools\ModelUtilities\KinematicLimits`` folder.


***********************
AMMR 2.1.1 (2018-06-12)
***********************

.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1287730.svg
   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1287730

The AMMR 2.1.1 version is a minor release of the AMMR with smaller changes and bugfixes.
The AnyBody Managed Model Repository now has a DOI (`10.5281/zenodo.1250764 <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1250764>`__).
This is handled by `Zenodo.org <https://zenodo.org/>`__ (The European Open Science platform hosted at CERN).

**Added:**

* Added a ``Leg.Seg.Foot.GroundJoint`` RefNode to the foot segment of the TLEM2 model. This RefNode was
  also present in the TLEM1 model and was used by few applications.
* New ``GroundVelocity`` setting added to the ``ForcePlateAutoDetection`` class_template, which
  makes class usable with instrumented treadmills.
* All force plate types now have a user-definable ``ForcePlate.CalMatrix`` variable. The feature is useful to
  easily compensate for errors in the c3d file (i.e. swapped channel and wrong sign)

**Changed:**

* Enhanced the :ref:`multi-trial MoCap example
  <sphx_glr_auto_examples_Mocap_plot_Plug-in-gait_MultiTrial_StandingRef.py>` for best practice for
  MoCap trials with multiple subjects and trials. The example now shows how to deal with multiple
  subjects and storing the c3d files in a separate folder.


**Fixed:**

* Corrected the default mass of the patella segment in the TLEM2 model from zero to 0.025.
* Add missing unilateral reaction between TS node on Scapula and the Thorax when using the shoulder rhythm.
* Adjusted the initial wrapping vectors for the semitendinosus,
  semimembranosus, and biceps caput breve muscles around the knee. This has no
  influence on the output of the model, and is only done to reduce the risk of
  the muscles wrapping the wrong direction around the wrapping surface.
* AnyMoCap:

  * The high memory usage of the AnyMoCap BVH model has been fixed. The high memory usage was due to a reference in the ``CreateMarkerDriver`` class template
    which caused the studies to include the BVH input data multiple times in the output.
  * The BVH and multi-trial examples now use zero phase shift filtering of force plate forces.
    The zero-phase filter can be important to ensure that forces are synchronized with kinematic data.
  * Fix bug in Type 1 Force plate when data is not in meters (i.e. ``PointScaleFactor != 1``).
    The PointScaleFactor was applied twice to the z moment component.
  * Fix a problem reading C3D files where force plate meta information
    is saved with the wrong dimensionality. Such a issue can, for example, happen if the c3d files
    are created manually in MATLAB.
  * The option to load parameter optimization results is no longer hidden when the
    ``MOCAP_CREATE_PARAMETER_ID_SHORTCUT`` is set to ``OFF``.




***********************
AMMR 2.1.0 (2018-03-22)
***********************

.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1251276.svg
    :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1251276

**Added:**

* New :ref:`squat example <sphx_glr_auto_examples_ADLs_and_ergonomics_plot_Squat.py>`
  model which demonstrates a parameterized squatting motion.

* New ``#class_template`` for adding limit drivers to kinematic measures.
  Can be included with ``#include "<ANYBODY_PATH_MODELUTILS>/KinematicLimits/KinLimit_template.any"``

* Muscle ColorScale can now be set from the ``Main.DrawSettings.Muscles.ColorScale``.
  If you port an older model to the new AMMR you will need to update your ``DrawSettings.any``
  file.

* AnyMoCap framework:

  * New argument ``DRAW_SCALE`` in the ``CreateMarkerDriver`` class_template to control the visual size of markers.
  * Added an option to the ForcePlateAutoDetection class template to make the limb1/2 contact detection
    mutually exclusive. Setting the option ``ALLOW_MULTI_LIMB_CONTACT=OFF`` will ensure that both legs cant
    be in contact with the plate at the same time. This can prevent accidental contact detection
    for the collateral leg in the swing phase.
  * New option to specify the contact nodes in ForcePlateAutoDetection class template. This makes the class useful
    for connecting force plate to other limbs than the feet.
  * Add support for the Shoulder Rhythm in AnyMoCap based models.
  * Add support for the :doc:`/body/detailed_hand_model` in AnyMoCap based models.

* New ``BM_FOOT_MODEL`` parameter, as preparation for integrating the Glasgow-Maastricht foot model (GM-Foot) back into the AMMR.
  Currently, the parameter can only be used for excluding the feet  (``#define BM_FOOT_MODEL _FOOT_MODEL_NONE_``).
  making it easier to work on integrating  the GM foot model.

.. seealso:: Adding the GM-Foot to the TLEM2 model is a work in progress. An early version is
              released on GitHub: https://github.com/AnyBody/gm-foot


**Changed:**

* Default mannequin drivers for the Pelvis are changed to drive the Pelvis
  anatomical frame instead of the segmental reference frame. This also fixes the
  discrepancy between the load time position and the mannequin driver position and
  makes the driver consistent with the interface measures
  ``BodyModel.Interface.Trunk.PelvisPosX/Y/Z``.

.. warning:: This change will affect models using the default mannequin drivers unless
    the driver values are updated.

* The Wilke spine pressure  validation examples have been updated and now uses
  the TLEM2 lower extremity model.

* In :bm_constant:`_SCALING_XYZ_` scaling law the definition of
  length/depth/width of the scapula is corrected to match the anatomical
  definitions.

* Updated the AAU Mandible Model introduced in AMMR 2.0.0. By accident the authors did
  not share the exact same version of the model that was used in the publication by
  `Andersen et al. 2017 <https://www.anybodytech.com/downloads/publications/#Skipper_Andersen2017-zd>`__
  This is now corrected and the validation  example produces the same results as
  published version.

* TLEM 2 model

  * Pectineus implementation has been adjusted based on the original MRI
    Scans. Only the most lateral element of the pectineus muscle was changed. This
    was done to prevent it from penetrating the femoral head in some situations.
  * Tweaked the Gluteus Maximum Superior implementation to reduce the risk of
    collisions between muscle insertions and the wrapping surface. The two most
    proximal insertion points of the Gluteus Superior are shifted more distally, and
    the locations of the wrapping surfaces are tweaked.

* AnyMoCap Framework:

  * Models now uses the default kinematic solver for the inverse dynamic analysis.
  * Changed the set joint drivers used for transferring the
    joint angles from the over-determinate marker tracking to the inverse dynamic analysis.
    To improve the stability of the scapula kinematics the Scapula Thorax Elevation angle is
    used instead of the sterno clavicula elevation angle.
  * Changed the way marker drivers are excluded from the Inverse Dynamic analysis.
    The drivers are now excluded using the new ``AnyMechObjectExcluder`` class instead of
    the ``MechObjectExlcude`` member of the Study. This has no practical effect on model output
    but means that the ``MechObjectExlcude`` can now be assigned by the users.
  * Update to the BVH MoCap example. Pre-processing the BVH data is now a separate operation which saves the
    virtual marker positions to a file. Thus, this step can be skipped the next
    time the model is reloaded.
  * Changed the AnyMoCap Multi trial example ``Plug-in-gait_MultiTrial_StandingRef`` to
    make it a better starting point for creating new models. 1. Moved the
    Human-Ground residuals from the Trunk to the Pelvis segment. 2. Use the TLEM
    2 lower body model in the example. 3. Disable upper bounds for the muscle
    recruitment ``Criterion.UpperBoundOnOff = Off;`` to improve the stability of
    the simulations.


**Fixed:**

* Shoulder-arm model:

  * Fixed problems with Pectoralis Major wrapping. Wrapping could fail unpredictively when
    muscles wrapped in the intersection between the coracoid wrapping and pectoralis
    minor cylinder. The coracoid wrapping cylinder has been removed, and the
    others has been made longer. This creates a more robust wrapping for the
    Pectoralis Major muscle.
  * Better initial position for scapula and clavicula. The initial position is now calculated
    from the initial position of the chain from thorax through the clavicula to
    scapula. This will not change the model output but should make the arm model
    more robust solving the first step.
  * Improve the Teres Minor wrapping by adjusting the
    wrapping surface, and ensure that the insertion point is not directly on the surface.
  * The "Evaluate joint strength" studies now also work when the shoulder rhythm is enabled.
  * Fixed problems with via points of the wrist extensor muscles colliding with the wrist
    wrapping surface in normal range of motion. The via point of Extensor indicis
    ``Via_Extensor_Indicis_pos`` has been slightly adjusted and the location of
    the wrist wrapping cylinder ``MedialExtensorCyl`` has been improved.

* Detailed hand model:

  * Fix a problem causing the hand to scale incorrectly.
  * Fix a problem with the default mannequin drivers for the left
    thumb, where CMC  and MCP abduction was treated as adduction.
  * Fixed compatibility between the detailed hand and scaling law :bm_constant:`_SCALING_XYZ_`.

* Lower extremity models:

  * Fixed various warnings when running calibration routines with the lower extremity models.
  * Fixed muscle insertions for the old leg model (``#define BM_LEG_MODEL _LEG_MODEL_LEG_``).
    The misaligned pelvis muscles insertions was a regression due to the updated
    Trunk pelvis introduced in AMMR 2.0. The pelvis muscles insertions have been
    translated and rotated to fit the new Trunk geometry as best as possible.
  * Fix missing left leg calibration operations when right leg was excluded.

* MoCap models:

  * Weak residuals for GRF prediction: Ensure the same strength is used in all directions for
    the weak recruited actuators.
  * Fix bug in ``CreateMarkerDriver`` class template which prevented the
    ``UseC3DWeightResiduals`` from having any effect.
  * Fix the wrong visualization of the contact area in ground reaction force
    prediction class template, when the base frame is different from the global
    coordinate system.
  * Wrong masses in the deprecated "old" MOCAP models. The model was not using the
    body mass specified in ``Main.TrialSpecificData.Anthropometrics.BodyMass``

* Other fixes:

  * Wrapping convergence for multiple muscles has been improved. This was done by
    tweaking the string-mesh of the muscles to improve the wrapping solvers ability to find
    the solution within the given number of iterations.












***********************
AMMR 2.0.0 (2017-11-29)
***********************

.. image:: https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1251274.svg
   :target: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1251274

Major changes:
==============

New lower extremity model (TLEM2.1)
-----------------------------------

* The `Twente Lower Extremity Model version 2.0 dataset
  <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.12.034>`_, developed in the
  TLEM\ *safe* EU project was implemented in the AMMR repository. The model is not
  the default model, but can be enabled with the :ref:`BM parameter
  <bm-config>` ``#define BM_LEG_MODEL _LEG_MODEL_TLEM2_``
* The model is versioned TLEM 2.1, to indicate the number of changes and
  correction which has been added in the process. The changes and updates to the
  TLEM2 dataset was done in the `Life Long Joints
  <https://lifelongjoints.eu/>`_ EU research project (paper submitted for publication).
* The most important changes to the TLEM 2 dataset include the following:

    * Updated wrapping for the Gluteus Maximus, Iliacus, Psoas around the hip.
    * Reworked muscle topology for Gluteus Medius and Gluteus Minimus
    * Updated wrapping for Hamstring muscles, and Gastrocnemius around the knee.
    * Redefined revolute knee axis and patella joint axis and patella tendon length based on the bone geometry.
      The original TLEM knee axis was estimated using a functional method, and was only valid
      for very small flexion angles.
      Thanks to Marco Antonio Marra (Radboudumc) for this for this improvement.
    * The  ratio of volume between Gluteus Maximus superior/inferior has been re-estimated
      based on the original cadaver MRI scans.
    * Update the Sartorius via points.
    * Re-implemented the Hip Joint location for the pelvis and the femur by fitting spheres to
      the femoral head and the acetabulum. This is in contrast to the original TLEM2.0 implementation
      where the hip joint center was found using a functional method.
    * Included a more detailed version of the patella bone.
    * Various minor bug fixes from the original implementation used in the TLEMSafe project.
    * Corrected the femoral attachment points for the popliteus muscle
    * Update ankle joint nodes with positions fitted to the bone geometry
    * Small correction to wrong insertion points for Adductor Longus and Vastus Medialis.

* See the dedicated :doc:`TLEM2.1 page </body/leg_tlem2_model>` page for more information.


AnyMoCap
--------

* New framework for running MoCap models. The AnyMoCap framework is an effort to
  create a simple and unified framework for doing any kind of MoCap analysis with
  the AnyBody Modeling System. See the :ref:`AnyMoCap example gallery <mocap_examples>`
  for more information.
* Algorithms and file for Ground reaction force prediction are added to: ``ammr/tools/GRFPrediction/``.
  See the
  :ref:`MoCap examples <sphx_glr_auto_examples_Mocap_plot_Plug-in-gait_Simple_FullBody_GRFPrediction.py>`
  for how they are used.

TLEM 1 updates
--------------

* The cumulated smaller bug fixes and updates to the TLEM1 model mean that we now
  denote the model 1.2.
* Changed the position of the Heel contact node, to align the heights of the
  TLEM1 and TLEM2 models.
* Added missing ``GeomScale`` function to the patella
  segment.
* Update ankle joint nodes with positions fitted to the bone geometry
* PSCA is now calculated based on the scaled fiber length. This aligns
  the TLEM 1 model with the new TLEM 2 model. It also means that scaling the model
  without changing the muscle volumes will change the strength of the model.
* Update scaling of the Patella tendon to work with non-linear scaling laws.
* Added visualization of the Fibula bone.


AMMR restructure
-----------------

* Added a top-level ``Tools`` folder helper files and other models which don't belong in ``Body/`` or ``Application``.
* Moved ``Body/AAUHuman/Toolbox`` to ``Tools/ModelUtilities``
* Renamed the ``Body/AUHuman`` to ``Body/Mandible_AU``
* Restructured the anthropometric ("AnyMan") folder.  The folder ``HumanModel.AnthroDataSubject`` is renamed to
  ``HumanModel.Anthropometics``. The structure of the folder has also changed with a ``SegmentDimensions`` and ``SegmentMasses`` subfolder.


Configuration parameters
------------------------

* The previously used system to configure human body using a BodyPartSetup file was completely
  replaced with the new body model (BM) parameters.
* Please see the documentation on: :ref:`BM parameters <bm-config>`.

Scaling laws
------------

* An additional scaling law based on individual segmental scaling factors was added to the
  repository. It can be enabled using this :ref:`BM parameter<bm-config>` ``#define BM_SCALING _SCALING_XYZ_``.
  See the :ref:`guide on scaling <scaling-intro>`.
* Default scaling is now :any:`_SCALING_STANDARD_` (e.g  ``#define BM_SCALING _SCALING_STANDARD_``)
  which scales all models to default standard 50% male.
* Introduced :any:`_SCALING_NONE_`, which disables scaling. E.g. models gets the original unscaled size.


New Mandible model
------------------

* Added new mandible model based on a CT scan of a 40 year old male.
  For more information see :doc:`the documentation for the model </body/aalborg_mandible>` or the
  :ref:`validation example <sphx_glr_auto_examples_Validation_plot_AalborgMandible.py>`.






Spine model
-----------

* :ref:`BM parameters <bm-trunk-config>` were updated to have control over each section of the spine and relevant components.
* The anatomical reference frame of the thorax segment was modified. This change reflects a change
  in the pelvic anatomical reference, and ensures upright posture for the standing postures, to
  align C1C0 joint with the hip joint centers.
* Boney surfaces of both pelvis and sacrum were updated and now correspond better to the relevant
  muscle attachments. These segments now also share a common scaling function. Hip joint centers
  were corrected for the old Leg model.
* Improved wrapping surface for Psoas Major muscles based on the TLEM2.0 MR scans
* Insertion, via, and attachment nodes of relevant muscles have been updated to match new geometries
  of pelvis and sacrum.


Arm model
---------

* The model now facilitates individual personalization for each side using nonlinear morphing schemes
  in a more consistent manner. Previously the morphing needed to be done on the right side and then
  reflect to have the left side morphing. This change removes an extra mirroring step.
* Arm calibration was updated
* :ref:`BM parameters <bm-arm-config>` have been updated for more convenient use. ``BM_ARM_DETAILED_HAND`` and
  ``BM_ARM_SHOULDER_RHYTHM`` are now used instead of individual switches for right and left side, which were deprecated.
* Muscle wrapping surfaces were updated for more physiological behavior.
* Scapula reaction contact forces were simplified, and do not longer utilize slider segments.
* Conoid ligament length now scales along with the scapula width.
* Add a ``GeomScale`` function the Clavicula segment.


Muscle models
-------------

* All muscle models are updated to support the structure of the new
  ``AnyMuscleModel3E`` and ``AnyMuscleModel`` in the AnyBody Modeling System 7.1.
  The following variables are renamed:

    * The "optimal fiber length" variable renamed from ``Lfbar`` to ``Lf0``
    * The "Pennation angle" variable renamed from ``Gammabar`` to ``Gamma0``
    * The "Tendon strain at F0" variable renamed from ``Epsilonbar`` to ``Epsilon0``

* Restructured the muscle model section of both TLEM1 and TLEM2 models.

  * All the original TLEM based muscle parameter are now located under: ``Leg/ModelParameters/Muscles``
  * All scaled muscle parameters are located in ``Leg/MusPar/SubjectMusPar``. This folder references
    the TLEM muscle and applies strength scaling etc. The ``SubjectMusPar`` folder and all subfolders are
    implemented with ``class_template``. Thus, all muscle parameter can now be overridden in applications
    by just assigning the variables a new value: E.g.

    .. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc

      Main.HumanModel.BodyModel.Right.Leg.MusPar.SubjectMusPar = {
        GastrocnemiusMedialis.MuscleVolume = 300; // Volume in mililiters
        GastrocnemiusMedialis.Pennationangle = 15; // (in degrees)
      };


Calibration
-----------

* Updated calibration for Arms and TLEM legs in the Body Model to

    * include muscles to the calibration study with search functions.
    * drive the postures using the measures from the interface folder to remain anatomically
      similar throughout future versions.

* Added new **experimental** two-parameter calibration, which is based on range-of-motion postures.
  The calibration type is controlled by the :any:`BM_CALIBRATION_TYPE` parameter.

  For example:

  .. code-block:: AnyScriptDoc

    #define BM_CALIBRATION_TYPE _CALIBRATION_TYPE_2PAR_

Minor Changes:
===============

* Added new initial guess for wrapping muscles, which make the wrapping
  more when the model starts in extreme postures.
* Update many examples to use the TLEM 2.1 model. See the :ref:`example gallery <examples-index>`.
* BM mannequin drivers are now implemented with a class_template allowing all weights and other settings to be customized.
* A default ``HumanModel.Mannequin`` folder is now automatically created with a ``class_template`` when no user-defined Mannequin file is set.
* A default ``Main.DrawSettings`` folder is now automatically created with a
  ``class_template`` when no user-defined :bm_statement:`DrawSettings
  <BM_DRAWSETTINGS_FILE>` file is set.
* Extra Mannequin drivers for the individual shoulder degrees of freedom:
  :any:`Sterno clavicula protraction <BM_MANNEQUIN_DRIVER_STERNOCLAVICULAR_PROTRACTION_RIGHT>`,
  :any:`Sterno clavicula elevation <BM_MANNEQUIN_DRIVER_STERNOCLAVICULAR_ELEVATION_RIGHT>`,
  :any:`Sterno clavicula axial rotation <BM_MANNEQUIN_DRIVER_STERNOCLAVICULAR_AXIAL_ROTATION_RIGHT>`
* The initial positions of the pelvis now use the anatomical reference frame.
  This follows the logic from the initial rotation of the pelvis which also uses
  the anatomical frame.
* DeltoidMuscleConnector segment loading time positioning now depends on the Humerus segment.
* Added `class template to easily create videos from AnyScript model <https://anyscript.org/tips-n-tricks/creating-videos-from-your-simulations/>`_.
  The tool requires that `FFmpeg <https://www.ffmpeg.org/>`_ is installed.
  The class template can be found in: ``<ANYBODY_PATH_MODELUTILS>/Video/CameraClassTemplate.any``.
  See `this blog post <https://anyscript.org/tips-n-tricks/creating-videos-from-your-simulations/>`_.
* In TLEM models make the opacity of the patellar tendon dependent on the opacity of the patellar surface.
* New ``AnyDoc`` classes are added to the different body model, so the GUI
  can create direct links to the documentation.
* Simplify the Scapular reactions to the thorax segment.
* Foot contact nodes are aligned with the AnatomicalFrame
* Updated the Wilke Validation example to reflect the forces for the AMMR 2.0 repository.
* Updates to BM parameters:

  * New :bm_statement:`BM_ARM_DETAILED_HAND` parameter for the detailed hand.
    The old ``BM_ARM_DETAIL_HAND_RIGHT``/``LEFT`` are deprecated.
  * New :bm_statement:`BM_ARM_SHOULDER_RHYTHM` parameter for controlling the shoulder rhythm.
    The old ``BM_ARM_SHOULDER_RHYTHM_RIGHT``/``LEFT`` are deprecated.
  * Added new ``BM_JOINT_TYPE_<joint>_<side>`` parameter for completely
    disabling joint and associated nodes in the lower extremity models. (See:
    for example :bm_statement:`BM_JOINT_TYPE_HIP_RIGHT`)
  * New :bm_statement:`BM_LEG_MODEL` parameter for setting the type of leg model
    used. The :bm_statement:`BM_LEG_RIGHT`/:bm_statement:`LEFT <BM_LEG_LEFT>` are
    now only :bm_constant:`ON`/:bm_constant:`OFF` options.


Fixed:
========

* Sign for the plantar flexion variable were reversed in some section of the
  model. This has been fixed.
* Bug in Mannequin drivers for the neck, where velocities were not set correctly.
  (Thanks to Assoc. Prof. Michael Skipper Andersen for reporting this)
* Fix small bug preventing ``StandingModelScalingDisplay`` from loading when using
  the :ref:`Leg <old_leg_model>` model.
* Fixed the opacity of the patellar surface in TLEM models, which pointing
  erroneously to the opacity of the talus.
* Fixed wrong symmetry of nodes on the C7 segment of full neck model.
* Latissimus Dorsi 5 fascicle was missing in ``MuscleNames.any``  and thus from
  many symmetry measures.
* Fixed a symmetry problem for the Deltoid muscles at the shoulder.
* Fixed a symmetry problem for the Disc stiffness from L1 to L5
* Fix white surfaces in examples with flat STL surfaces. For example
  :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_Sports_plot_CrossTrainer.py`.
* Fixed an issue preventing
  :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_ADLs_and_ergonomics_plot_StandingModel.py`
  from working with one leg.
* Fixed a problem with the drawings of the bones in the Arm model which were not
  always symmetrical.
* Fixed symmetry issues in scaling laws for scapula and clavicula,
  and humerus.
* Fixed a bug where a the Pectoralis wrapping cylinder was not a included in the calibration study.
* Fixed wrong sign for the AnklePlantarFlexion variable.
* Added missing GeomScale and AnatomicalFrame for Ulna segment.




Removed:
===========

* Old MoCap examples have been moved to ``Application/Examples/Deprecated``
* Removed the deprecated AMMR1.4 hip rotation sequences.
* The GM-foot model. A new version of this in the pipeline. Contact us if you are
  interested in this work.
* All older BodyModels which were deprecated in AMMR1.3
