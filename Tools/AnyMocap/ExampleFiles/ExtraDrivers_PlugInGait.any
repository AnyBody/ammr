// This file contains a set of auxillary drivers. They are usefull/necessary
// in some cases where the marker protocol doesn't provide enough information
// to specify all degrees of freedom. Hence, these drivers complement a

// to stabalize the solver in postures where the markers doesn't provide unique
// kinematic solution.
