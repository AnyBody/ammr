This model demonstrates how to replace the knee joint by a contact model 
using a total knee arthroplasty for a knee bend model.

The model is performing a knee bend, which is driven by positions of the hip and foot
and ground reaction forces added from external sources.
The knee joints (tibial femur joint and patella femur joint) from the standard repository body 
is excluded from the inverse dynamic study and a new joint is implemented using force dependent 
degrees of freedom (DOF). The forces in the knee joint are provided by a contact force between a 
femoral and a tibial implant(1) (defided into medial and lateral part), contact forces between the 
femoral implant and the patella as well as ligament forcess from medial and lateral collateral ligaments
and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and muscle forces.
For computational reasons, the model was reduced to simulate only one leg.

Please notice that this model is only for demonstration purposes of how to create a total knee 
replacement model using FDK, stl-surface contacts and ligaments. Although the stl-files used for 
defining the surface contacts come from the Grand Challenge competition, no other information from 
the completion were used in this model and, hence, this model cannot be regarded as a model based on 
the Grand Challenge data. 

The positioning of implements and positions, length and strength of ligaments are not based on any 
real anatomical data and are only adjusted to show the concept of creating a TKA model.
