This model shows how to use the `EvaluateMaxLoad` class-template to estimate 
the maximum loading where `MaxMuscleActivity` reaches 1.

The `EvaluateMaxLoad` needs to have a argument with the study, as well as pointer 
to the variable which controls the loading. The variable can be anything, as long as
it controls some external force or moment on the model. 

In this example we use the `EvaluateMaxLoad` class-template to evalate the maximum 
torque the model can provide at every timestep in the study. 

:::{Note}
The tool asumes a linear relationship betweeen the external load and the
maximum muscle activity. This is almost always the case, but it is woth considering if 
this assumption holds. 
See [this blog post](https://anyscript.org/tools/estimating-maximum-model-strength/) for more details.
