/**
The essence of a gait model is that it is a complex movement that is driven by means of kinematic data collected by
a motion capture system. To have something fairly standardized and accessible, we grabbed the motion data and ground 
reaction force measurements from the book by Vaughan et al: Dynamics of Human Gait. These data sets have been placed 
in the public domain and are available from the ISB homepage. We used the "Man" dataset.

The gait model is driven directly by the marker coordinates from the motion capture experiment. These coordinates have 
been saved on text files and are driving corresponding points on the computer model. To avoid kinematical over-determinacy,
we have selected only as many driver coordnates as we have degrees of freedom in the model. We use the ISB-recommended 
coordinate system with x forward, y vertical, and z lateral and drive the following coordinates:

The model is driven by setting of drivers between the free floating markers (blue) and the markers on the bones (red), 
for selected dof.

Sacrum in (y), Right and left ASIS in (x), Right and left knee in (x), Right and left malleolus in (y),
Right and left metatarsal in (x, z), Right and left heel in (x, y, z),
Right and left ASIS  and Sacrum in (z), combined as RAsisZ+LAsisZ=SacrumZ

These drivers are sufficient to determine the kinematics of the 3-D model. AnyBody reproduces the movement 
and computes individual muscle and joint forces.
