/**
This application is a model of a human standing on a floor and capable of
attaining different postures. The model is fully supported under both feet 
regardless of their positions.

The model also allows the user to specify loads at predefined key points 
in a simple way, and the posture as well as the external loads are 
controlled by means of the mannequin.any file.

The model can be a good starting point for new applications involving 
the entire body.
