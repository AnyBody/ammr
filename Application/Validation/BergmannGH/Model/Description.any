/** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This model is used for investigation of the fidelity of the shoulder model
by comparing computed GH joint reactions against in-vivo measured reactions
by Bergmann et al published in the Journal of Biomechanics.

The model is as precise as possible a remake of Bergmann's experiment, and
the shoulder model has been equipped with a force mesurement object that
reads out the forces in the humeral coordinate system similarly to the
instrumented shoulder prosthesis.
