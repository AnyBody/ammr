//This is a model of a arm curl
//The human body consist of a fullbody model

//The objective of this example is to adjust the eccentricity of the cable wheel such that the 
//arm muscles experience a constant effort throughout the elbow flexion taking the change of 
//moment arms of the muscles into account. 

//It is not possible to obtain a completely constant muscle effort with only the eccentricity 
//as parameter. However, if more parameters were introduced into an actual design optimization,
//then it is likely that an almost completely uniform effort profile could be obtained.

//By chaning between the files "EnvironmentOptimized.any" and "Environment.any" it is possible to 
//to see the machine with adjusted eccentricity and the one with zero eccentricity
