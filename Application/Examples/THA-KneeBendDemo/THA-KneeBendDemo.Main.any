/**
This is a demo model for the simulation of a knee bend for a body model 
with a total hip arthroplasty (THA)using:
    - either an ideal spherical joint with joint reaction forces
    - or force dependent kinematics and a contact model.

In the body model, the hip joint is excluded from the AnyBodyStudy and a new force dependent 
hip joint is included. Therefore, a acetabular cup and a femoral component (1) are included into the model 
and a contact force between these implants is defined. For stabiliy reasons an artifical spring
is implemented to avoid the joint to disconnect.

Please notice that this simulation is only a demo example.
The placement of hte implant is not based on any anatomical data.
Further, the implant includes an artificial spring (in Model/ContactForces.any) 
element to make the simulation more robust. For each simulation, the force produced 
by this artifical spring should be checked to be aware of the influence
of this spring on the results.
