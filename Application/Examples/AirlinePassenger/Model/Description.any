/** --------------------------------------------------------
This is a model of a coach class airline passenger seat 
characterized by the following:
- No arm rests (you always lose the battle for the armrest
to the person next to you)
- Horizontal seat pan
- Limited ability to incline the backrest due to the lack
of clearance to the person behind

The model assesses the comfort of the passenger in terms of
the following:
- Muscle effort computed as the percentage of maximum
voluntary contraction to maintain the given posture.
- The total shear force between the seat pan and the
buttocks of the passenger. Shear forces are known to 
cause particular discomfort in static loading situations,
typically as when the passenger tries to sleep.

The posture of the passenger is controlled by the backrest
angle. The bacrest offers pressure support for the back 
of the human model but no tension support. This means that 
forward leaning postures are realized by inclining the 
seat forward and the body is not getting any support from
the backrest in this situation.

The inverse dynamic analysis of the model inclines the 
backrest backwards from an initial 10 degree forward 
inclination to a 30 degree backward inclination, which
is on the very upper limit of coach class passenger seats.
