/**2-D bicyle model.
Although this model can be rotated in 3-D space it really is just a saggital
plane pedaling model with only a few muscles in each leg. The beauty of 
pedaling is that it is one of the few cases of biomechanics that can be modeled
reasonably on two dimensions only. 

The 2-D legs are supplemented with models of the bike frame, crank, and
wheels.

You can do lots of interesting stuff with this model:
- Investigate the influence of the bicycle design
- Change riding parameters sich as cadence and output power
- Separate internal work for acceleraton of body segments
from external work on the crank.*/
