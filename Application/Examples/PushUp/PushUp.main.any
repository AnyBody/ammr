/**
This model shows a model of a push up 

The model displays several topics
-Block building techniques
-Include files
-Structuring of models using directories

The positions of the hands can be controlled by chaning variables in the file
Environment.any

Known issues:
1: The model seems to be too weak for the load applied when doing pushups, this is a sign that the shoulder needs more 
adjustments before it becomes reliable
