This application is a model of a human standing on a floor and capable of
attaining different postures. The model is fully supported under both feet 
regardless of their positions.

The model also allows the user to specify loads at predefined key points 
in a simple way, and the posture as well as the external loads are 
controlled by means of the mannequin.any file.

The model can be a good starting point for new applications involving 
the entire body.



  -------------------------------------------
   1) Visulalization of muscle force vectors:
  I you want to visualize the muscle force vectors, there are three things to do:
  - browse to the file MusDrawSettings, you can find it in the folder Body\AAUHuman\DrawSettings
  - include this statement:
                           #include "DrawMuscleForce.any"
                           (in this file you can also set some parameters like scaling of length of the force vectors)
  - exclude the drawing of the muscles by setting the Variable Visible = Off in the Drawsettings file a few lines above
  -------------------------------------------
  2) Moving Camera
  if you want to create movies from your simulations you might want to add a camera object which allows you to control the 
  position and motion of the viewpoint. This can be done by including this statement:
                           #include "MovingCamera.any"
  in the study folder below. This will create a camera object and save pictures in the folder "MovingCamera" which is located 
  inside this application folder. The camera can be controlled to be fixed in space or move during the simulation.
  details can be found in the MovingCamera file
